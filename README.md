# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Create a deep-learning neural network to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## Project Overview

A neural network is a powerful machine learning technique that is modeled after neurons in the brain. Neural Networks can rival the performance |of the most robust statistical algorithms without having to worry about any statistical theory. Industry leaders such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and amazon use an advanced form of neural networks called Deep Neural Networks to analyze images and natural language processing datasets. 

In this project, we'll explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. We'll discover how neural networks are designed and how effective they can be with complex datasets, With neural networks. We can combine the performance of multiple statistical and machine learning models with minimal effort. In this project, we'll also use some of the techniques shares by the world's top data engenieers. We will prepare input data and create a robust deep learning models for complex and irregular data. By the end of this project, we'll able to design, train, evaluate and export neural network to use in any scenario.
